Awarded for live Python demos + clear explanation of cryptography’s past, present, and quantum future.

### Journey I Presented (with Working Code)
| Era                | Topic                     | Live Python Demo                       | Key Takeaway I Explained                     |
|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Ancient            | Caesar Cipher             | Shift encrypt/decrypt                  | First known cipher                           |
| Renaissance        | Vigenère Cipher           | Poly-alphabetic tool                   | "Le Chiffre Indéchiffrable" for 300 years    |
| Modern             | Hashing + Salting         | Password hashing example               | Why we never store plain passwords           |
| Modern Asymmetric  | RSA & ECC                 | Full RSA key gen + encrypt/decrypt     | Based on hard math (factoring)               |
| Quantum Threat     | Shor’s Algorithm          | Google quantum images + explanation    | Breaks RSA/ECC in minutes                    |
| Future             | Post-Quantum Crypto       | NIST standards overview (Kyber, Dilithium) | Lattice-based = quantum-resistant        |

### Live Demos Included

**Final Message I Delivered**  
“Quantum computers are coming. RSA will fall. The future is lattice-based cryptography, and we need to start preparing now.”
